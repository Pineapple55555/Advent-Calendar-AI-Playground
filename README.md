# Advent Calendar | AI Playground Hackathon Project Nov 2024
## Brief:
A festive mashup of an advent calendar respecting the true spirit of Christmas featuring hamsters, stupid jokes, and way too obscure facts.

## GPT API Files:
There are four files needed: all the files in the "public" folder, and app.js. You also need to install Node for Javascript.

Ask Ben (s5703131@bournemouth.ac.uk or benmarkmason@gmail.com) for the API key if you cannot find the word document - or, if you are a part of the development team, check your emails for the invite sent on 06/11/24. Insert the key where it says "const apiKey = null; // Ask Ben for the API key (s5703131)" on line 20 (as of the time of writing).

I will not be keeping the API key in the project, as I'm the one who pays for each query.

To run the API server, type "node app.js" into the VSCode cmd with app.js and public together in an opened folder and click the hyperlink. A joke, fact, or quiz question will appear in the web browser - all generated by ChatGPT in real time.
